# NAME

Data::Paginator - Pagination with Moose

# VERSION

version 0.05

# SYNOPSIS

    use Data::Paginator;

    my $pager = Data::Paginator->new(
        current_page => 1,
        entries_per_page => 10,
        total_entries => 100,
    );

    print "First page: ".$pager->first_page."\n";
    print "Last page: ".$pager->last_page."\n";
    print "First entry on page: ".$pager->first."\n";
    print "Last entry on page: ".$pager->last."\n";

# DESCRIPTION

This is yet another pagination module.  It only exists because none of the
other pager modules are written using Moose.  Sometimes there is a Moose
feature – MooseX::Storage, in my case – that you need. It's a pain when
you can't use it with an existing module.  This module aims to be completely
compatible with the venerable [Data::Page](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Data::Page).  In fact, it's a pretty blatant
copy of Data::Page, lifting code from some of it's methods.

# SETS

This module provides behavior compatible with [Data::PageSet](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Data::PageSet), allowing you
to break your pagination into sets.  For example, if you have a large number
of pages to show and would like to allow the user to 'jump' X pages at a time,
you can set the `pages_per_set` attribute to X and populate the links in your
pagination control with the values from `previous_set` and `next_set`.

# ATTRIBUTES

## current_page

The current page.  Defaults to 1.  If you set this value to to a page number
lesser than or greater than the range of the pager, then 1 or the last_page
will be returned instead.  It is safe to pass this numbers like -1000 or 1000
when there are only 3 pages.

## entries_per_page

The number of entries per page, required at instantiation.

## last_page

Returns the number of the last page.  Lazily computed, so do not set.

## next_set

Returns the number of the next set or undefined if there is no next.

## pages_per_set

If you have a large number of pages to show and would like to allow the user
to 'jump' X pages at a time, you can set the `pages_per_set` attribute to X
and populate the links in your pagination control with the values from
`previous_set` and `next_set`.

## previous_set

Returns the set number of the previous set or undefined if there is no
previous set.

## total_entries

The total number of entries this pager is covering.  Required at
instantiation.

## first

Returns the number of the first entry on the current page.

## first_page

Always returns 1.

# METHODS

## entries_on_this_page

Returns the number of entries on this page.

## first_set

Returns 1 if this Paginator has pages_per_set.  Otherwise returns undef.

## last

Returns the number of the last entry on the current page.

## next_page

Returns the page number of the next page if one exists, otherwise returns
false.

## page_for ($count)

Returns the page number that the $count item appears on.  Returns undef if
$count is outside the bounds of this Paginator.

## previous_page

Returns the page number of the previous page if one exists, otherwise returns
undef.

## set_for $page

Returns the set number of the specified page.  Returns undef if the page
exceeds the bounds of the Paginator.

## splice

Takes in an arrayref and returns only the values which are on the current
page.
